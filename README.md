# Our mission :airplane:

Welcome! We're going to build a landing page, so basically what we did last week but better and we'll do it in only **30 minutes**. Thanks, Materialize!

We've given you an HTML file that's adapted from one of Materialize's starter template. It's complete with nice-looking navigation and footer (you've already seen how frameworks make it easy to create those, from the last workshop). We also have a nicely formatted section in the middle for you.

ðŸš€ What do you need to add? Better title styles, images, and button effects! Plus, a modal **(OR SOMETHING ELSE IDK)**

Also, while we go through the tutorial, you might find it helpful to have <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> open so you can check out cool features, classes, and effects yourself. There's plenty of cool stuff that we won't cover that will make YOUR website much cooler.

## Basics

ðŸš€ Add in some lines to the `head`:

```
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="css/materialize.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection"/>
  <link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection"/>
```

ðŸš€ Let's make "Hi CS52" and the text under that stand out. **(somebody do this)**

**code: need to make it `<h1 class="header center orange-text">Hi CS52!</h1>` and `<h5 class="header col s12 light">Let's spruce up this landing page in 30 minutes.</h5>`

## Fix up the logo (somebody do this)

ðŸš€ Grab an image from the internet to replace the text that says "Logo". We're going to make your image into a circle!

**(do tutorial on how to add the code in)**

code

## Stylize the icons (Ke got this)

ðŸš€ Have them add style to the button - make button normal, but they need to stylize it plus give it the wave effect, and another can do pulse effect

code

## Modal (2 people do this)

ðŸš€ Work on a modal or a collection? Or a carousel, unless that's too hard

## And You Are Done!
