# Build a Landing Page!  :airplane:

Welcome! We're going to build a landing page, so basically what we did last week, but better and we'll do it in only **30 minutes**.

🚀

```html
<a href="#">
```


## Setting up Materialize

🚀 Download stuff

🚀 Use our template file

🚀 Link the Materialize CSS file or something

**Things to notice:** 


## Navigation bar

Create an awesomer nav bar. Here are some examples - use one of these or check out Materialize for other built-in classes.

* `<nav>` for the navbar (even though it is transparent).
* `<ul>` unordered lists are often used for nav components, if you do it'll help to get rid of the bullets using `list-style-type: none;`
* `<footer>` is a good tag to use for... footer things.
* `<div>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<h1>`, `<p>` will all be useful.
* `<input>`, and `<button>` for any form like elements.



## Adding in Fonts

Right, in the above you may have noticed that yours was Times New Roman...

🚀You should get some better fonts quick from [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com)! 🐎

🚀And you might as well grab some nice icons while you are at it from [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/). Easiest is to just download the whole fontawesome package and including that in your source.

## Background

🚀Go ahead and add a background in!

I recommend getting rid of margin and padding on body:


```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

and then creating a top level div, lets call it main:

```css
.cover {
  background-image: url(img/yourimageyname.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
}
```

## Flex Boxes


**Note:**



## Styling



## Media query


🚀Here's how to start:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 640px) {

}
```


🚀Take some of your row flex boxes and simply convert them to columns.  This works remarkably well for many cases.  The input box and button for instance.

```
display: none;
```

🚀Toggle the display property on completely different sections of the site.  You might have a completely different set of elements for the links section for instance.  Toggle one off and the other on.
