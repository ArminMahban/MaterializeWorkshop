# Our mission :airplane:

Welcome! We're going to build a landing page, so basically what we did last week but better and we'll do it in only **30 minutes**. Thanks, Materialize!

ðŸš€ In teams of 3, build an awesome landing page for new company called ------. They do something -------- cool, and want an eye-catching new website. May the best page win! Hint: they love cool animations and effects.

Also, while we go through the tutorial, you might find it helpful to have <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> open so you can check out cool features, classes, and effects yourself. There's plenty of cool stuff that we won't cover that will make YOUR website much cooler.

## Setting up Materialize

ðŸš€ Download stuff

ðŸš€ Use our template file

ðŸš€ Link the Materialize CSS file or something

**Things to notice:** 

## Grid and Layout

ðŸš€ 



## Navigation bar

Create an awesomer nav bar. Here are some examples - use one of these or check out Materialize for other built-in classes.

REPLACE THIS CODE STUFF
* `<nav>` for the navbar (even though it is transparent).
* `<ul>` unordered lists are often used for nav components, if you do it'll help to get rid of the bullets using `list-style-type: none;`
* `<footer>` is a good tag to use for... footer things.
* `<div>`, `<span>`, `<a>`, `<h1>`, `<p>` will all be useful.
* `<input>`, and `<button>` for any form like elements.

## Footer

While we're at it, let's spruce up the footer too.



## Collections

ðŸš€

REPLACE THE CODE
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```


## Modals




## Buttons and effects

Now it's time to spruce up your buttons with cool effects. We'll check out the built-in "raised" and "flat" button styles, as well as the "wave" and "pulse" animations.

## Add in your team members!

Let's circle up a square image for the logo!
