# Our mission :airplane:

Welcome! We're going to build a landing page, so basically what we did last week but better and we'll do it in only **30 minutes**. Thanks, Materialize!

We've given you an HTML file that's adapted from one of Materialize's starter template. It's complete with nice-looking navigation and footer (you've already seen how frameworks make it easy to create those, from the last workshop). We also have a nicely formatted section in the middle for you.

ðŸš€ What do you need to add? Better title styles, images, and button effects! Plus, a modal **(OR SOMETHING ELSE IDK)**

Also, while we go through the tutorial, you might find it helpful to have <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> open so you can check out cool features, classes, and effects yourself. There's plenty of cool stuff that we won't cover that will make YOUR website much cooler.

## Basics

ðŸš€ Add in some lines to the `head`:

```
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="css/materialize.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection"/>
  <link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection"/>
```

ðŸš€ Let's make "Hi CS52" and the text under that stand out.

Find the "Hi CS52!" text. We want `h1` to include `class="header center orange-text"`.

Let's also change the text under that. Give `h5` some classes. Let's do `class="header col s12 light"`, or some other combination of classes. Up to you!


## Fix up the logo (somebody do this)

ðŸš€ Grab an image from the internet to replace the text that says "Logo". We're going to make your image into a circle!

**(do tutorial on how to add the code in)**

## Stylize the icons (Ke got this)

ðŸš€ Add some style to the buttons!

For Button 1: replace `<button>Button 1</button>` with `<a class="btn">Button 1</a>`. This is a standard button. Notice it already looks good and has a cool hover effect.

Let's add a cool click effect. Instead of just `class="btn"`, make it `class="btn waves-effect waves-light"`. Click the button, it's so cool!

* Overview of what will be attempted
* Any necessary setup steps
* Step by step instructions
* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices
  
End the tutorial with a "what you should have at this point" section which includes a **short** listing of features. This is the minimal set of things you think they should accomplished/learned during the course of the tutorial and will be used in grading. Format this as a checklist:

- [x] created navbar
- [ ] styled body
- [ ] clickable buttons

For Button 2, replace the old button with a round button. Do the same thing as Button 1, but instead of `btn`, use the class `btn-floating`. You can change the color by adding a class, like `cyan`. Let's try out Materialize's icon package too. Between `<a>` and `</a>`, add in `<i class="material-icons">add</i>`. 

By the end of this, button 2 should look like: 
```
<a class="btn-floating waves-effect waves-light cyan"><i class="material-icons">add</i></a>
```

For Button 3, replace the old button with `<a class="btn btn-floating pulse"><i class="material-icons">cloud</i></a>`. Check out the cool effect!

## Modal (2 people do this)

ðŸš€ Work on a modal or a collection? Or a carousel, unless that's too hard

## And You Are Done!
