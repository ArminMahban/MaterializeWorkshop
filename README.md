# Our mission :airplane:

Welcome! We're going to build a landing page, so basically what we did last week but better and we'll do it in only **30 minutes**. Thanks, Materialize!

We've given you an HTML file, complete with nice-looking navigation and footer (you've already seen how frameworks make it easy to create those, from the last workshop). We also have a nicely formatted section in the middle for you.

ðŸš€ What do you need to add? Better title styles, images, and button effects! Plus, a modal **(OR SOMETHING ELSE IDK)**

Also, while we go through the tutorial, you might find it helpful to have <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> open so you can check out cool features, classes, and effects yourself. There's plenty of cool stuff that we won't cover that will make YOUR website much cooler.

## Basics

ðŸš€ Add in some lines to the `head`:

```
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="css/materialize.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection"/>
  <link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection"/>
```


ðŸš€ Do something with the title

code

## Fix up the images

ðŸš€ Do something with the images (give them square images here, they'll make them circles. maybe it can be a team page with profile shots?)

code

## Stylize the icons

ðŸš€ Have them add style to the button - make button normal, but they need to stylize it plus give it the wave effect

code

## Modal

ðŸš€ Work on a modal or a collection? Or a carousel, unless that's too hard

code




## And You Are Done!
